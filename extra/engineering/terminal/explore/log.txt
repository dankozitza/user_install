They found a cave.

They tamed a cave bear.
Jiitt killed the cave bear.
Rob and Dan murdered Jiitt.
They set up shop in the cave and are living in it.

240123:

The weather outside is nice. The sun is out and there are no clouds.
The space ship is parked outside the cave. It seems nobody was
expecting Jiitt and we are safe for now. Our crime looms over our
heads like a dark cloud. Rob can barely sleep knowing that he
killed an innocent man. If we are lucky nobody will ever know
and we can continue living as if nothing happened. Dan decides now
is the time to dispose of the body and learn what he can about
Jiitt.

Jiitt's journal:
Just before Dan chucks Jiitt's dead body into the fire outside
a journal falls out of Jiitt's pocket. It is a well kept record
of his life. He clearly put a lot of energy into recording the
events of his life. He also noted the location and weather with
each event. He also wrote about many secret locations here in
the forrest. Apparently Jiitt was a master explorer and hid
his most precious items in various locations throughout the
forrest.
